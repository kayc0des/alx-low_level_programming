### Description
Introduction to commonly used search algorithms.

### Requirements
* Only `printf` from the standard library is allowed
* Files containing big O notations will use this format:
  * `O(1)`
  * `O(n)`
  * `O(n!)`
  * n*m -> `O(nm)`
  * n squared -> `O(n^2)`
  * sqrt n -> `O(sqrt(n))`
  * log(n) -> `O(log(n))`
  * n * log(n) -> `O(nlog(n))`
